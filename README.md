## Project Overview
**PogodaAI** is a fully autonomous, low-cost weather and air quality monitoring station designed for educational, research, and environmental applications.  
It combines **modular hardware** based on the **ESP32 microcontroller** with **solar power management**, a suite of **environmental sensors**, and a **custom AI model** predicting air quality trends.

The entire system is **open-source**, **DIY-friendly**, and designed for easy replication and modification.

!!!Disclaimer!!!
The AI model and training scripts are available in a separate repository:
[PogodaAI-backend](https://github.com/krzkr80/pogodaAI-backend) made by Krzysztof Kurbanow

This repository focuses on the hardware development â€” including 3D design, electronics, and assembly instructions for the autonomous weather station.

## Main Features
- **Energy autonomy:** operates 100% off-grid using a solar panel + Li-Po battery.  
- **Modular architecture:** each sensor and component can be replaced or upgraded independently.  
- **Multi-sensor integration:** PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10 (PMSA003), temperature, humidity, pressure, VOC (BME680), light, rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction.   
- **3D-printed housing:** durable PET-G design, fully documented for easy printing and assembly.  
- **Wireless connectivity:** ESP32 with WiFi transmission and SD card logging.  
- **Open source:** all hardware, firmware, and CAD files are publicly available.

## Custom Mechanical Components

The **anemometer** and **wind vane** were designed specifically for this project:  
- Carbon tubes (10 mm Ã˜, ~250 mm long)  
- 6200 bearings (2â€“4 pcs)  
- PET-G 3D printed parts (~100 g)  
- Gap sensor (for rotation counting)  
- Magnet + magnetometer (for direction detection)
